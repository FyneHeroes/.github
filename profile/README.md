Welcome to Fyne Heroes, a collection of people who help to direct the [Fyne](https://fyne.io) project.
In this organisation you will find discussions about what is planned and what is new for the Fyne toolkit and lots of apps in the wider ecosystem.

We appreciate everyones contributions so far, we will be updating this page as more is discussed.
Read on if you would like to know more.

## Get involved

There is a roughly monthly email update of activity and ideas which is taken from the project but also from this community.
If you would like to be kept up to date you can sign up to the Fyne Heroes mailing list below.

[<kbd>â€ƒ<br> ðŸ“« Join the discussion ðŸ“« <br>â€ƒ</kbd>](https://zcmp.eu/Gzx)

After signing up you can reply to messages to suggest ideas or future topics - contributors will be awarded "Fyne Hero" membership :smile:.
Of course if you want to ask questions or get help using Fyne there are plenty of support channels open -
see the Fyne [support page](https://fyne.io/support/).

## Why is this not in the Fyne project?

There are two main reasons to keep this area separate:

1. A chance to have bigger picture discussions than the feature request / issue process of the main project.
2. Everyone who contributes is awarded "Fyne Heroes" organisation membership (separate to the "Fyne" membership which is reserved for core contributors).
