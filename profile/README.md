## Why is this not in the Fyne project?

There are two main reasons to keep this area separate:

1. A chance to have bigger picture discussions than the feature request / issue process of the main project.
2. Everyone who contributes is awarded "Fyne Heros" organisation membership (separate to the "Fyne" membership which is reserved for core contributors).
