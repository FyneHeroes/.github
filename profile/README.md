Welcome to Fyne Heros, a special place where people gather to help direct the [Fyne](https://fyne.io) project.

We appreciate everyones thoughts and input so far, please read on if you would like to know more.

## Why is this not in the Fyne project?

There are two main reasons to keep this area separate:

1. A chance to have bigger picture discussions than the feature request / issue process of the main project.
1. Everyone who contributes can be awarded "Fyne Hero" status and organisation membership, separate to the "Fyne" membership, reserved for core contributors.

## Get involved

Most discussions so far have been over social media - you can find various places to discuss on the Fyne [support page](https://fyne.io/support/).

For people who prefer email, and want to be kept up to date you can also sign up to the Fyne Heros mailing list below.
